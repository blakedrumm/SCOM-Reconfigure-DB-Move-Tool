# SCOM-Reconfigure-DB-Move-Tool
  This application is designed to allow users to migrate their SCOM SQL Instances to a new location. With that said, the application will only edit database values if selected or potentially edit the configuration file (ConfigService.config) and Registry to allow the Management Server(s) to use the updated SQL Instance / Database.
